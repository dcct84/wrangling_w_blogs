3,Enfoque EducaciÃ³n,Standardized tests: a race to nowhere?,"I just saw ""Race to Nowhere,"" a documentary that is being widely discussed in the United States. This documentary was produced by a mother, Vicki Abeles, about the stress that school was causing her twelve-year-old daughter. The film is a critique of the ""wave"" of educational accountability sweeping the United States and which is manifested in the useâ€”indiscriminate use, say criticsâ€”of standardized tests. This ""wave"" has no political affiliation, since it was adopted by both the Bush administration (No Child Left Behind) and that of President Obama (Race to the Top). â€œRace to Nowhereâ€ spearheads a movement that challenges the concept of ""educational success"" measured by the number of college-level courses that high school students take (advanced placement), the quantityâ€”not qualityâ€”of content learned, and above all by a meritocracy strictly based on individual success.â€¨â€¨Supporters of this backlash movement immediately point to potential unwanted effects of such a system: lack of teamwork, lack of innovation, and little creativity. This is exactly the opposite of what we need for education in the 2 s Century. In the film, Deborah Stipek, director of Stanford Universityâ€™s education program, says it is paradoxical that people in China ask how to emulate the creativity and innovation of U.S. students. This is a fascinating discussion for Latin America. First, public opinion in our countries is paying more attention to the poor results we get on international tests (such as PISA) and regional tests (such as SERCE). Media coverage generated by the publication of PISA 2009 demonstrates the extent of the debate on accountability. On the other hand, the debate encourages us to consider the possibility and desirability of expanding the concept of what we mean by quality to include measurement of 21st Century skills that build on our social and cultural values. And even beyond measurement, can we consider the importance of values such as solidarity, community, and adaptability to change as ingredients for a quality education?",English,https://blogs.iadb.org/educacion/2011/03/11/standardized-tests-a-race-to-nowhere/,Marcelo Cabrol - marceloca@iadb.org,3/11/2011
6,Development that Works,"Welcome to the blog ""Development that Works""","Ensuring that operations of the Inter-American Development Bank produce effective impacts on the developing countries of Latin America and the Caribbean is at the heart of the Bankâ€™s ninth capital increase. The mission of the Office of Strategic Planning and Development Effectiveness is to ensure that we meet this mandate, that we do the right things and that we do them well. That what we plan is designed to produce results, that what we finance we measure first and that we verify the desired results have been achieved. With this preamble we welcome you to the new blog â€œDevelopment that Worksâ€, to explore this issue in Latin America and the Caribbean and open up the conversation to the general public. This subject is too important to leave solely in the hands of specialists. Here we will present ideas, examples and case studies of what works and what does not work, with contributions from the IDB itself (PDF) as well as our clients, partners, other development institutions, NGOs and academia. We will ensure that these contributions always meet strict standards for quality and relevance. We invite you to join and participate in this conversation.",English,http://blogs.iadb.org/desarrolloefectivo_en/2011/03/17/welcome-to-the-blog-development-that-works/,Koldo EchebarrÃ­a - koldoe@iadb.org,3/17/2011
8,Development that Works,Development in Latin America: why it matters to know what projects work,"When the Chinese Premier Zhou En Lai was asked about the impact of the French Revolution, he reportedly said it is too early to tell. For a development bank such as the IDB, which lends more than US$12 billion a year, it is never too soon to know the impact of Bank-financed funded projects, or which policies have the best chances of success. And why does it matter? According to Esther Duflo, one of the worldâ€™s most influential young economists, it is important because more than one billion people across the globe live on less than a dollar a day; and because more than nine million boys and girls die each year before reaching the age of five, the majority from diseases that are easily and completely treatable. This blog is a place to learn, for example, that: â€¢	For a Mexican child, having a concrete floor (PDF) can mean a 30 percent increase in cognitive capacity.
	â€¢	A Colombian girl with a voucher to partially pay for private school tuition has an additional 10 percent chance of finishing eighth grade.
	â€¢	A child of a poor farmer in Argentina (PDF) receives more education if the parent has a title for his property. This is a blog that will apply the most rigorous professional standards to discussions on how to make effective investments, avoid following failed policies, and not repeat past mistakes. What is not measured is not known, and what is not known, is misspent.",English,http://blogs.iadb.org/desarrolloefectivo_en/2011/03/22/development-projects-why-it-matters-to-know-what-works/,Francisco MejÃ­a - franciscome@iadb.org,3/22/2011
12,Enfoque EducaciÃ³n,Cloning the best teachers in Latin America,"We donâ€™t have to be experts to recognize that the major factor in getting a good education is a good teacher. Think about your own experiences at school, and surely you can easily identify the teachers who made a big difference in your lives. In my opinion, the Latin American countries have many good teachers, from whom we can learn best practices and therefore replicate their results. For this reason I liked the presentation that Bill Gates gave this last week to the Governors Association of America. Gates was asked what is the best investment given spending limits on education in the fiscal crisis that is affecting almost all of the U.S. states. His answer was to identify, reward, and, above all, replicate the good teachers. While other professionals such as Doctors and engineers are constantly improving methods and techniques by copying their more successful peers, teachers do not follow this practice. I would like to highlight a specific proposal that Gates made that would be of interest to our countries in Latin America, and which is related to the use of technology (no, not giving a laptop to each student). It is installing low-cost video cameras in classrooms. These cameras focus in turn on the teachers and the students, and enable the teachers to make self-assessments of their classes and observe the reactions of their students. This is not a new idea (filming in class is used for teaching evaluations in Chile), but it is not widely practiced in the region. The Gates Foundation is pushing this concept in the United States, and I know many foundations and philanthropists who could do so in Latin America. This is the kind of innovation that is needed in Latin America and the Caribbean, in which the priority is to achieve greater effectiveness in education. After a decade of sustained growth in per capita income, our performance on international educational tests (PISA) is still below what would be predicted by our countriesâ€™ income levels. The most successful countries in this test are most often those that make the greatest efforts to improve the quality of their teachers, and the results are clear; all achieve results much higher than what would be predicted by their wealth.",English,https://blogs.iadb.org/educacion/2011/03/22/cloning-the-best-teachers-in-latin-america/,Marcelo Cabrol - marceloca@iadb.org,3/22/2011
